# Homebrew

## Install Homebrew

Install homebrew as described in their documentation:

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

When command line tools are run from within applications (e.g. Sourcetree), an
command line is used without loading the .bash_profile file. This results in
commands that not can find binaries installed trough homebrew.

Run the following command and reboot to fix this:

```bash
sudo launchctl config user path /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

## Wget

Tools like drush require wget. Install it using homebrew:
 
```bash
brew install wget
```

> Note: This will also install openssl. 

## pkg-config

pkg-config is required to install some PHP extensions. Install it up-front:

```bash
brew install pkg-config
```

## Update GIT to latest version

Homebrew has a more recent version of Git.

```bash
brew install git
```
